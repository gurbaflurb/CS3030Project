# CS3030Project
Our project for this semester was to build a Discord bot using python. Our bot will be able to generate memes based on user input, there will also be parameters to change or set the meme image background. We are also planning on adding the ability for the bot to make Markov Chains out of user messages sent to the server. We are also planning on adding an optional word filter to remove messages that include certain words.

## Setup your own Bot
- Go through the process of adding a bot in the discord developer portal: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
- Then add the bot using the OAuth2 menu to get the bot url
- Copy the token for the bot to login with under the Bot menu 
- On the server you need to run the command `pip3 install discord.py` Since there is no requirements.txt file to use yet
- Then you can run the command `python3 bot.py` on linux, or `py -3 bot.py` on Windows.
- When prompted input the token you have and the bot will be online and ready to use.


## Todo
