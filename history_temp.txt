I made this server so we can mess around with the bot, here's the Authentication token so you can try it out when you're making edits and such ```

```
alright
$HELLO
$hello
ahhh yes very cool

Great!!! Love it. Very interesting project. Make sure the memes are not created randomly. Everything you do should have a reason. You can even search for libraries that by passing a text, they output if the text is happy or sad, etc. (https://github.com/tlkh/text-emotion-classification) With that you could make your memes more accurate. Looking forward to it!

Can you check to see if this zenhub link works for you? https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/memebot-5d941732c8e4d80001227d92/board?repos=206346637
I shouldve added you as a contributer so you should be able to change stuff
I can see it
cool

I'll get working on this project tomorrow or saturday
aight, i'm just trying to figure out how to get the chat history
I can spin up an AWS server for us to deploy the bot on if you want
do you have the link for the tutorial you were following?
sure
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=history#emoji
thanks
just the documentation
ok
aight, i'll spin up an AWS machine for us to use
give me one sec
also i've been trying to follow what my friend did for his bot https://github.com/notderw/Penelope/blob/master/bot.py
Here's the ssh key for the new instance
the ip is `18.222.48.164`
user is `ec2-user`
$history
$history
so if I want to change something with the bot what do I do
is it on your computer currently?
yea but I only have like 2 lines changed
okay
I started reading through a tutorial
kk
for the github should we just have our own env folder locally, because I am having trouble with your env
I was having trouble with it too, not sure what the issue was
havn't had much luck with using on are different machines
what?
*havn't had much luck with using envs on different machichines
oh yea, same, I'm not sure why it breaks
my mind says one thing and my fingers type something else
moooooood, honestly i'll probs just make a requirements.txt file so you know what to have installed and then just copy/save the bot.py
we could do the pip freeze thing maybe
yea
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-upload-an-image
this should be a good cheat sheet
pic
wrong server
lmao
my bot will send random pictures now
you can check it out on my branch
you need to change the token in the .env file though
prob shouldn't store it there long term lol
I'm use the bot class now, which is a sub class of the client class, but more convient for making bots
I think it needs to be online
I keep doing it here by accident
haha
yesssss
it was actually really easy to do that
Nice
so for each template I say we should prob store all its info in a shelve module or something
that would be smart
text size, text region, font
and then we can pull from a global list of frases, nouns, verbs, other images ect...
exactly

I noticed your files were using tabs, should I switch from spaces to tabs?
hmm, mine should be using 4 spaces when I press tab
almost got cogs working
cool
idk where this came from
I changed nothing and ran it again and it worked
I pushed my changes to github
I made a folder for cogs
ok
so you should just have to put your own cog classes there
idk if we want all the cogs to be one file or not but whatever
you can put the spongebob text in the FunAndGames cog I made
ok
If I russian Rouette my self, will I actually get kicked lol? I dont know if I can since i'm owner
idk if it works at all
lol
only mods and admins have tried it
very true, let me see if I can add someone and force them to play
okay
Can you see the playgame channel?
no
ok one sec
how about now?
yeah
cool
i'm trying to get it so that only people with the role player can see just playgame
seems like it doesn't work
maybe because of the person who calls the command
I see
could do it like !rr username
and then mods could rr random people
haha
I made a pull request
look at the name of my last commit lol
haha lol
finals week is 16th - 19th right?
ye
okay
when is the last db class?
also we need gem5 integration with our discord bot
Excuse me
after you get all your commands set up with cogs, I think the next course of action is to start on the markov chains and that emotion library
I think you're right
small pull request on the bot for whenever you get around to it
```python
            elif(num is 2):
                uwuMsg = uwuMsg + " "
            elif(num is 3):
                uwuMsg = uwuMsg + " UwU "
            elif(num in [i for i in range(4,12)]):
                uwuMsg = uwuMsg + " "
```
num is 2 and the last conditional do the same thing right?
also isn't the last line the same as saying: `num >= 4`
Made some comments and resolved some of the comments you made
one sec I'll take a look at makeUwUText function
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246736425159098382/651584827975532554/temp.jpg

good enough
first of all I am not an incel. I literally went on a date a week ago, so I’m not incel. Second, you don’t even know that there are different extremities of incels. I want an egalitarian world, not a gynocentric world. Third, there is a common misconception that all incels want is sex. Yet I am not even ready for sex. Fourth, don’t assume someone’s ideologies based on one thing they said. Just because you can’t handle the truth doesn’t mean you should go out and say “I’m wrong” without validly proving your point. I was mainly going off of science, and apparently most people in the world don’t agree with science if it doesn’t fit their ideologies, even if science is true. That is like even if Trump appeals to you and you agree with his viewpoints on issues, you still vote Clinton because you call yourself a Democrat. So if you could kindly educate yourself a lot more about Incels, TRP, and other related topics before you say stuff, I would appreciate it. But as I know of how stubborn you are, you won’t even consider looking deeply into topics and act like you know so much about them. This is what separates people like you and people like me. I look at both sides of every argument, and choose the one that is most rational, not go off of what other people say is “cool”. I rationally choose what I think is best for myself, my family, my community and my country. If you would like to know more about what I believe in, ask me (I know you won’t and you would still make stupid assumptions about me that aren’t true) in what I believe is right or wrong and not just say random shit that doesn’t align with my ideologies. Ya so please stop saying shit about me that isn’t true.
